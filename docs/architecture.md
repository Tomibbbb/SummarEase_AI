# SummarEase Architecture

## Overview

SummarEase follows a cloud-native microservices architecture to provide a scalable, resilient, and maintainable text summarization service. The system is designed to handle asynchronous processing of summarization requests and enforce usage limits via a credit system.

## Components

### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React-based user interface
- Provides user registration, login, and text submission
- Displays summaries and credit information

### Backend API (FastAPI)
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Manages user credit system
- Processes text submissions and queues them for summarization
- Provides endpoints for retrieving summaries

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- Stores user information and credentials
- Keeps track of credit usage
- Maintains records of submitted texts and summaries
- Tracks processing status

### Queue System (Redis + Celery)
- Handles asynchronous processing of summarization requests
- Manages worker distribution and fault tolerance
- Ensures fair processing of requests

### Hugging Face API Integration
- Connects to external AI service for text summarization
- Handles API authentication and error handling
- Processes text into summaries

## System Flow

1. User authenticates with the system
2. User submits text for summarization
3. System checks if user has sufficient credits
4. If credits are available, system deducts credits and queues request
5. Celery worker picks up the request and calls Hugging Face API
6. Summary is stored in the database
7. User is notified when summary is ready

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless API design allows horizontal scaling of backend services
- Celery workers can be scaled independently based on processing load
- Database can be migrated to managed cloud service for improved availability
- CDN can be used for static asset delivery
